# Review-to-502C-50-50W-Class-D-ampllifier
This is Wuzhi Hi-Fi class D amplifier which can output a maximum of 100watts. This works on a voltage under 24volts and has a stable output.

Operating a class D amplifier is really easy and on the other hand it is very difficult to DIY one, because the power supply section and the PWM section is really complicated. Any different value component can produce hum and destroy the overall performance. I am working on the existing very stable class D amplifiers designs. But in order to explore more about the amplifiers I got my hands on Wuzhi 50+50w Hi-Fi amplifier kit. Which comes with a TPA3116 amplifier IC from DfRobot. The kit is listed on Dfrobot and named as 502C Hi-Fi amplifier.
 
 Although you would not get the full fledge performance boost on 12volt. In last I will also show my designed prototypes which are assembled by JLCPCB SMT assembly service.

Working of amplifier:

The amplifier is very loud and class D is working very stable under full load. The output is balanced due to high power and better-quality LC filter. Never use linear power supplies with class D amplifier. The class D amplifiers works on a single power supply of 0-24 and the output is just a square wave filtered to get the sound. In real the high frequency operation of these amplifier causes some serious problems if you are a music lover. In that case you can use class A and AB amplifiers. By the way, Class D has some great lead in terms of efficiency (90%) and low heat.
 
DF robot the product-based company which deals in electronics like sensors, microcontroller and robotics. They own a beetle series of microcontrollers having a very small form factor in the same performance. You can see the more detailed on DF microcontroller from here.
